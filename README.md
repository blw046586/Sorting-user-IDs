# Sorting-user-IDs
Given code that reads user IDs (until -1), complete the quicksort() and partition() functions to sort the IDs in ascending order using the Quicksort algorithm. Increment the global variable num_calls in quicksort() to keep track of how many times quicksort() is called. The given code outputs num_calls followed by the sorted IDs.

Ex: If the input is:

kaylasimms 
julia 
myron1994 
kaylajones 
-1
the output is:

7
julia 
kaylajones
kaylasimms
myron1994
